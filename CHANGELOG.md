# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Rule behavior changes (new rules, FP-rate changes against the corpus,
severity changes) are first-class entries here — rule IDs are immutable
once shipped, so this file is the record of what changed between versions.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-27

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Rebranded from QA Doctor to Mjölnir.** Package name is now
  `mjolnir-qa` (bin: `mjolnir`). Config file: `mjolnir.config.json`.
  Data directory: `.mjolnir/`. Badge: `mjolnir-badge.json`.
- Score label: "SCORE" → "WORTHINESS".
- Verdicts: "HEALTHY" → "WORTHY", "CRITICAL" → "UNWORTHY".
- Environment variable: `QA_DOCTOR_ASCII` → `MJOLNIR_ASCII`.
- SARIF tool.driver.name: "Mjölnir".
- Repository: `github.com/Sergey-Bar/Mjolnir`.
- CLI: all help text, error messages, usage strings reference `mjolnir`.
- Generated workflows: `mjolnir.yml`, `npx mjolnir-qa@latest`.

### Added

- `--format mermaid` — test-architecture diagram (Sprint 9).
- `--tone blunt` — opt-in blunter messages (Sprint 9).
- Milestones — first flawless scan / first debt reduction announced once.
- New MJÖLNIR ASCII art logo (minimal Nordic hammer).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (adversarial-audit hardening wave)

- **QA-TEST-003**: the assertion-detection regex contained a literal tab
  character (`\t`) instead of `to`, so `.toThrow()`, `.rejects.toThrow()`
  and `.resolves.*` were never recognized as assertions — tests whose only
  assertion was `await expect(p).rejects.toThrow()` were flagged as
  "no assertions" with error severity. Fixed; must-not-fire fixture now
  covers `rejects`/`resolves` forms.
- **workflow-parser**: the YAML alias-bomb guard ran AFTER parsing, i.e.
  after a billion-laughs document had already expanded. Alias counting now
  happens before parse, and the parser additionally enforces
  `maxAliasCount` during parse.
- **CRLF/BOM robustness**: files are normalized once at read time (BOM
  stripped, CRLF → LF). Previously `$`-anchored Python rules missed every
  assertion line on Windows checkouts.
- **Terminal deduction table** now uses the same evidence-discounted math
  as the score (`deductionFor`), so displayed numbers reconcile with the
  reported score when E0/E1 findings exist.
- **JSON/SARIF truncation removed**: results were silently capped at 50
  findings, including machine consumers. The full finding set is now in
  JSON/SARIF; only terminal display is capped (with an honest count).
- **`qa-doctor fix` path containment**: plugin-supplied finding paths can
  no longer write outside the scan root (`../` traversal refused).
- **Symlinks are no longer followed** during test-file discovery in any
  adapter — prevents scanning outside the repo and link cycles.
- Plugin reserved-prefix blocklist extended to all core families
  (`QA-JV`, `QA-CS`, `QA-PLUGIN`).
- `doctor:playwright` bad-usage exit code unified to 10 (was 2).

### Changed (adversarial-audit hardening wave)

- QA-TQUAL-002 and QA-PW-004 detection now runs on a comment-stripped /
  comment-and-string-free AST view of the file: patterns inside prose
  comments or string literals no longer fire (FP firewall).
- QA-TQUAL-011 (commented-out test) now scans actual comment ranges via
  the compiler scanner instead of raw-text regex — `it(` inside a string
  literal is no longer flagged, and without an available AST the rule
  conservatively reports nothing rather than flooding false positives.
- `--scope changed` now includes GitHub workflow files and Playwright
  configs changed in the diff, not just `*.spec/test.*` files.

### Added

- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 0.1: expanded the false-positive corpus with two
  additional Python repos (`pytest-dev/pytest`, `psf/requests`) so all
  QA-PY-001..012 rules are exercised against real code via
  `npm run corpus:audit`.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) per Upgrade-Plan-v3 critical item #3:
  user-visible rule behavior changes get a first-class entry from now on.
- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 1: five new TypeScript/Playwright rules —
  QA-PW-141 (retries without flake-triage loop), QA-PW-142 (blanket
  `page.route()` mocking), QA-PW-143 (no screenshot/video on failure),
  QA-PW-144 (single-browser project matrix), QA-PW-145 (no accessibility
  assertions; absence-based, `falsePositiveRisk: high`).
- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 2: eight new Playwright-Python rules on the
  Python adapter — QA-PY-101 (sync/async API mix), QA-PY-102 (`time.sleep`
  in Playwright tests), QA-PY-103 (`wait_for_timeout` as sync),
  QA-PY-104 (brittle selectors), QA-PY-105 (UI-driving test without
  assertions), QA-PY-106 (shared page/context across tests), QA-PY-107
  (`networkidle` wait), QA-PY-108 (hardcoded environment URLs).

- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 6: Plugin API — declare third-party rule packages
  in `qa-doctor.config.json` (`"plugins": [...]`). Security model: no
  sandbox (same trust as ESLint/Vitest plugins); reserved core rule-ID
  prefixes rejected; load failures degrade honestly as QA-PLUGIN-000
  warnings without affecting exit codes. Plus cross-file duplicate-test-name
  detection (`src/engine/cross-file.ts`).

- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 0.2: new `@qa-doctor/playwright-reporter` package
  (`packages/playwright-reporter/`) — official Playwright JSON reporter
  wrapper for QA Doctor's forensics pipeline; default output
  `qa-doctor.report.json` is the CLI's auto-discovery convention.

- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phase 3: ts-morph AST precision layer behind the `ast`
  seam (`src/engine/ts-ast.ts`). QA-PW-002 and QA-PW-005 migrated from
  regex to syntax-tree detection (legacy regex kept as fallback). No
  scoring changes — golden lock byte-identical.

- Upgrade-Plan-v3 Phases 4+5: new language adapters — Java
  (`src/adapters/java.ts`, rules QA-JV-101..105) and C#/.NET
  (`src/adapters/csharp.ts`, rules QA-CS-101..104). Core Playwright rule
  families ported: disabled/skipped tests, hard sleeps, missing assertions,
  shared browser state, wait-timeout misuse. Rule-ID registry now accepts
  QA-JV/QA-CS families.
